    Vest is a powerful form validations framework inspired by the syntax and style of unit testing libraries like Mocha or Jest. It uses their declarative structure and makes it easy to write complex form validations that are also easy to read and maintain.
    Vest changes we think and about validation logic in our apps. Let's see what goes into building such a framework."`,

    I am going to talk about how you don't need to consider all the components of design systems, we take what we need and make our project beautiful and scalable. Let's talk about consistency, component library and think of design systems together.`,

    In this presentation, we'll explore the What, Why and How of Functional Programming and also take a look at how to use functional programming with popular languages to write code that is scalable, readable and easy to maintain - all the things good code should be."`,
