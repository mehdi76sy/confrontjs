    abstract: `Design systems are everywhere. At some point, we’ve all used bootstrap, material, or shoelace.  But we end up tweaking and changing and struggling with out of the box solutions, until we begin to fantasize about creating our own design system. 
    But what does that process look like? What happens behind the scenes? Do we get enough value to justify the cost? 
    This talk will describe the journey we took at Vonage to create our own design system, the challenges we faced on the way, and the surprising insights that turned an internally used tool into a customer facing product.`,

By understanding what’s behind the javascript engine, one can prevent performance issues by writing better javascript and avoiding a big percentage of the optimization phase. In this talk, we will learn about the JS engine, how it works and how it relates to performance. We will then dive into practical examples from real-life applications. Using live coding, we will see how to monitor and fix performance issues. At the end of this talk, you will be able to monitor your app’s performance, tackle performance issues, and note performance bottlenecks while writing or reading the code.`,

    Vest is a powerful form validations framework inspired by the syntax and style of unit testing libraries like Mocha or Jest. It uses their declarative structure and makes it easy to write complex form validations that are also easy to read and maintain.
    Vest changes we think and about validation logic in our apps. Let's see what goes into building such a framework.`,

    I am going to talk about how you don't need to consider all the components of design systems, we take what we need and make our project beautiful and scalable. Let's talk about consistency, component library and think of design systems together.`,

I will define state management library responsibilities and show you how to evaluate one. After this presentation you will be able to pick state management solution appropriate for your project. Or maybe create your own library - sorry!`,
