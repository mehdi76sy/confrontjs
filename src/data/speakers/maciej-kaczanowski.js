  bio: {
    en: ` In love with ReactJS and TypeScript since 2018.
          JavaScript constantly amazes him by finding its ways to be useful when not expected – in Node server, Electron and React Native apps, to name a few. By day, Maciej works on web and mobile apps, by night – on JavaScript based games based on React, Electron and React Native. A husband and a father of two amazing sons.
