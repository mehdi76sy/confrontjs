    en: "Geek: I love learning, especially new theories, languages, tools, how stuff works and new ways of solving problems (both common and rare). If it’s supposed to be interesting for me, it has to be creative and challenging - thus I’m pursuing a career in programming, and in spare time (besides more programming) I play guitar, wargames and paint miniatures (for these wargames).",
