    <h3>Dear ConfrontJS Community! ðŸ’œ</h3>
    <p>
        We believed up until the latest hour, that we could provide a safe environment and a thoroughly enjoyable time for our community and guests, inviting all of you to join us on ConfrontJS 3rd edition.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the latest reports and covid-19 spread statistics in Poland, the emergence of dangerous and potentially more contagious <i>Omicron</i> variant of the virus, new governmental restrictions have been widely introduced, which could result in causing us all to undergo a quarantine, especially those who travel. This would result with unreasonable costs for hosts, speakers and atendees alike.
        This new development makes it nearly impossible for us to host all of you safely within our conference venue.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Therefore, with our deepest regrets, we have decided to postpone our ConfrontJS event until <span class="primary-color">March 26th, 2022</span>.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        All the tickets already purchased are valid for the new date. We will also fully refund all the returns upon request. To claim your refund, please email us <a href="mailto:confrontjs@warsawjs.com">confrontjs@warsawjs.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope you will understand our position, and will be more than happy to proceed with our agenda early next year!
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope to see you on <strong>March 26th 2022</strong>!
    </p>
    <p>
        The ConfrontJS Team
